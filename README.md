# VBA Practice

This Excel spreadsheet employs a VBA code to process stock market data. 

Attached are three screenshots of data for the years: 2018, 2019, and 2020.

Attached also is the VBA code used to obtain this data. 

To run the code, ensure that macros are enabled within the Excel sheet containing the data. Navigate to the Developer Tab and click on the Macros Button. As only one macro was used, the provided code should be all that is necessary.

After inputting the code, run it to generate the results shown in the attached screenshots. The provided code establishes rows, variables and column headers. It processes the data and includes conditional formatting to distinguish the different sets. (green for postive, red for negative).

It adds columns for "Ticker". "Yearly Change", "Percent Change", and "Total Stock Value". It also identifies stocks with the greatest percent increase/decrease and total stock volume.

The code features two loops. One loop is employed to gather data and provide it, while the other processes the data in each worksheet.

Overall, the code serves its purpose of finding the data provided.
